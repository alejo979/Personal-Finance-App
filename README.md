Personal Finance App for tracking Income and Expenses

This is a Comand Line Interface, where I implemented a simple personal finance app which helps tracking personal income and expenses. As an initial step, few initial features have been implemented. Data is stored in a database (SQLite)

  * Create or Access and existing account
  * 2 internal sub-accounts: Card and Cash
  * Type of transactions: Income, Expense, Transfer (only transfers from card to cash implemented, within same account)
  * View all transactions
  * View filtered transactions by month & either type of transaction
  
If you have any comments or feedback, they are fully welcome.
GUI version with tkinter is in process!
